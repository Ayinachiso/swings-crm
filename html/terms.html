                <p>Without limiting the above, SWINGS CRM, its suppliers, resellers, partners, and their respective affiliates will not be liable for any amount exceeding the payment made by you to SWINGS CRM for the products, software, or services. If the products, software, or services are provided free of charge, SWINGS CRM and its suppliers will have no liability to you.</p>
                <p>The limitations of liability mentioned above will be applicable regardless of whether the damages occur due to the use or misuse of the products, software, or services, the reliance on them, the inability to use them, or the interruption, suspension, or termination of the products, software, or services (including damages incurred by third parties). These limitations will still apply even if the limited remedy fails to serve its essential purpose, and they will be enforced to the maximum extent allowed by law.</p>
                <p>The things we make are not meant to be used for dangerous things like nuclear, aviation, mass transit, or medical applications. We won't be responsible if someone uses them for those things and something bad happens.
