              <p>
                  When you contact us, we obtain certain information from other companies. For instance, if you provide us with your email address to express your interest in becoming our customer, we will receive verification from a third-party company that offers automated fraud detection services to us. Sometimes, we gather information from social media websites already available to the public. You can decide how much of your information is made public on these websites by adjusting your privacy settings.
              </p>
              <div class="space-20"></div>
              <h5> <b>DO WE DISCOLOSE THE INFORMATION WE GATHER TO THIRD PARTIES?</b></h5>
                <p>We might share the information we gather, including personal and non-personal data, with third parties like advertisers, contest sponsors, marketing partners, and others who provide our content or have products/services that might interest you. We may also share it with our present and future affiliated companies and business partners. If we are involved in a merger, asset sale, or other business reorganization, we may share or transfer your personal and non-personal information to our successors-in-interest. </p>
                <p>We may seek assistance from trusted third-party companies in various areas, such as maintaining our website, storing data, managing email communication, handling payments, assisting customers, and delivering purchased items. We will likely share some non-personal data with these third parties to enable them to perform these services for you and us.</p>
                <p>We might give some of our log file data, like IP addresses, to third parties such as web analytics partners, app developers, and ad networks for analysis purposes. If your IP address is shared, it can be used to roughly determine your general location and gather other technical information like your connection speed, whether you have accessed the service from a shared location, and the type of device you used to access the service. Details about our ads and your platform activity may be gathered and subsequently utilized to conduct audits, research, and reports that benefit both us and our advertisers.</p>
                <p>
                    We may share your personal and non-personal information with government officials or private parties if we believe it is necessary to respond to claims and legal processes, protect our rights or the rights of others, ensure public safety, prevent illegal or unethical activities, or comply with court orders and laws.

                    We make sure your information is safe by taking the necessary measures. We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to protect your data, prevent unauthorized access, maintain security, and use your information correctly. However, it's important to note that no one, including encryption systems, is completely immune to potential security breaches. Also, people can do bad things on purpose, make errors, or not obey rules. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its security. If the law requires us to protect your data, we promise to follow it. If not, we will be held responsible for any intentional wrongdoing.

                        Google Maps API is a robust tool used to create a custom map, a searchable map, check-in functions, display live data synching with location, plan routes, or create a mashup, to name a few. The Google Maps API might collect data from you and your device to ensure safety. The Google Maps API gathers data stored in compliance with its privacy policy.

                        We use cookies to make our service seamless, but you don't need them to use it. Cookies help us show videos and remember your login information, so you don't have to enter it every time you visit.

                    <span>
                        Local storage, sometimes called DOM storage, provides web apps with methods and protocols for storing client-side data. Web storage allows for long-term storage, similar to cookies, but with a much larger capacity and without storing any information in the HTTP request header.

                <h5><b>INFORMATION ABOUT THE GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (GDPR)</b></h5>
                <p>
                    If you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), we might gather and utilize your information. We will explain in this part of our privacy policy how and why we collect this data and how we keep it safe from being copied or misused.

                <h5><b>WHAT IS GDPR?</b></h5>
                <p>
                    GDPR is a law in the EU that ensures companies safeguard the data of EU residents and gives EU residents more control over their data.
                </p>
                <div class="space-20"></div>
                <h5><b>WHAT IS PERSONAL DATA?</b></h5>
                <p>Any information related to an identifiable or acknowledged individual. </p>
                <p>
                    GDPR protects many types of information that could be used to identify a person, either alone or when combined with other information. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personal data goes beyond just a person's name or email address. It includes things like financial details, political views, genetic information, biometric data, IP addresses, physical addresses, sexual orientation, and ethnicity. The Data Protection Principles requirements are as follows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Personal data gathered should be handled fairly, legally, and clearly and only be utilized as an individual reasonably anticipates.</li>
                    <li>Personal data should only be gathered for a particular reason and solely utilized for that purpose. When organizations collect personal data, they must explain why they need it.</li>
                    <li>Personal data should not be stored longer than is required to serve its intended purpose.</li>
                    <li>People under GDPR can access their data and request a copy, update, delete, restrict, or transfer it to another organization.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="space-20"></div>
                <h5><b>WHY IS GDPR IMPORTANT?</b></h5>
                <p>
                    GDPR introduces new rules on how companies should safeguard the personal data they gather and handle. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing more fines for breaches. In addition to these facts, it is just the correct action to take. At Help Scout, we believe strongly that your data privacy is more important, and we already have solid security and privacy practices in place, going beyond the requirements of this new regulation.

                <h5><b>INDIVIDUAL DATA SUBJECT'S RIGHTS: DATA ACCESS, PORTABILITY AND DELETION</b></h5>
                <p>We are committed to helping our customers meet the data subject rights requirements of GDPR processes or store all personal data with fully vetted, DPA-compliant vendors. We keep all conversations and personal data for up to 6 years unless you delete your account. </p>
                <p>In this scenario, we adhere to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy by appropriately discarding all data, but we ensure that we do not keep such data for more than 60 days. </p>
                <p>
                    We understand that if you work with EU customers, you must be able to let them access, update, retrieve, and delete their personal information. Don't worry, we got you covered! We've been set up as self-service from the start and have always given you access to your information and that of your customers. Our customer support team is available to help you with any questions you may have regarding using the API.
